# SEA-X - Detection and Analysis of Plastic Waste




### What we aim to do

Reduce the amount of plastic wastes in the ocean

### How are we doing that?

A platform that combines Drones and GIS technology, leveraging AI to identify and analyze plastic waste on water bodies

### How does it work?

### Website to test the app

It was built with power apps and deployed with Streamlit

### Another Approach

Tried to acheive the same results from Yolov5 by leveraging a UNet CNN architecture. This research uses the same dataset, preprocessing method but with a UNet model and a extra layer. The results are a displayed differently in that using semantic segmentation to show the mapped areas and a collective accuracy rather than individual predictions.

A similar poster was presented at Data Scientist Bootcamp 2019, but this one has been improved using a different approach, Efficent Unet. Here's the poster of the previous one.
